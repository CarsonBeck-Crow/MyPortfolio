            <h2>Humanity of Storallia</h2>
            <h3>By Carson Beck</h3>

        <section id="story-content" class="story-content">
            <p>
                The story of Humanity begins with the Storyteller. The world was new, and many other races existed, they
                lived largely separate from one another, and their cultures were all very distinct from each other. The
                storyteller was nearly ready to take the back seat to let his new world flourish, but the world needed a
                final touch, the human race, the storyteller began to dot the world, and it's different continents with
                men and women, largely the same, but all different from one another in their own ways, some light skinned,
                some dark, some in between. They were all created equal, and all created with the intent to bring a new
                social aspect to the world. The humans were meant to mix with the other races, creating new offspring, and
                bringing the different cultures and societies together.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning there were eight primary, and distinctly different human civilizations. The Centurion,
                the Norn, the Ur, the Ord, the Fell, the Deladun, the Hindi, and the Druma were the different civilizations,
                and each were different in appearances. Each could be found scattered around the world in different places,
                and though they primarily stuck to their own, quite a lot of them travelled the world, and moved around.
                The Human race was beginning to migrate around the world, and meet with the other races, and invited them
                to come and join them in their kingdoms which they had begun to build. The first of these cities to rise
                were The Kingdom of Zaradine, ruled by Zachary of the Centurion, The Urban Empire ruled by Krav of the Ur,
                and The empire of Dunadora ruled by Masud of the Deladun. These kingdoms were epicenters of diversity, and
                are cited as three of the greatest cities in all the world. This was long before other large cities rose,
                Kinhold of the Norn, Hindgaurd of the Hindi, Frontwind of the Ord, Vulmura of the Druma, and Homestead of
                the Fell. All of these cities became capitals of the world's countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                After some time, Urban became the largest city in the world, and they sought to break down the borders of
                the world, and rule it all from Urlend under one empire. They started an alliance with Orden, and became
                one country for a time. Czar Krav offered partial leadership roles to that of the Emperor of Frontwind
                Emperor Nori. From there Urlend sent ships to the other countries, including Elfend and Valendor which had
                become countries themselves to avoid rule by humans. These ships were sent with offers from Czar Krav
                himself to each different kingdom, and of these Kingdoms only Hindgaurd accepted, and their Leader, a man
                named Hadi, was also given partial leadership in the Urlend empire. Czar Krav, Czar Hadi, and Emperor Nori
                joined together in a fearsome alliance known as the Urwindgaurd Alliance. Krav had Hadi send his soldiers
                from Hindgaurd to Delmora and set out to capture the capital Dunadora. Hadi did exactly that, and with that
                came the first conflict in mortal history. The Hindi attacked the Deladun city, and the people were not
                ready. The Hindgaurd had constructed weapons meant for killing men, and all that the people of Dunadora
                had were tools meant for farming, and hunting animals. The city fell overnight to Hindgaurd control, the
                people were devastated, and imprisoned for not bowing down to the Alliance. For the first time in history
                the mortals fought, for the first time in history people died. From this conflict came a new god. The God
                of Death Akavum.
            </p>
            <p>
                News of the atrocities from Dunadora spread like wildfire, and soon much of the world was preparing for
                war. A new pact was formed between Centralis, Nornen, and Feldron. Elfend, and Valendor which were
                primarily the homes of nonhuman races, opted not to be pulled into human affairs, and Windrum intended to
                stay neutral in order to trade with both sides and profit. King Zacharia of the Centurion, Yarl Vulfkin
                of the Norn, and Chief Takoda of the Fell joined together to create a pact against the Alliance, the war
                of the Alliance of Urwindgaurd vs the Pact of Kin. The Pact began to forge weaponry and in the meantime
                the Alliance began to make use of their newly captured country. Delmora was the perfect place for them to
                begin attacking from, as it was much closer to their enemies, and they had large mountains guarding them
                from invaders trying to free the country. While this was happening Emperor Nori sent a group of soldiers
                to the East across the sea to Valendor, Valendor was not going to be as easy to take as Delmora, but if
                they could capture the dwarves they would surely win the war. The dwarves were known for their fine
                craftsmanship and the Alliance sought to control that, and use it to build their war machines. Siege
                weapons, large boats, and new weapons, and armor. However the dwarves knew that something like this could
                happen. They had set up large barrels of explosive powder they'd been using to mine with magical traps to
                explode like landmines on their shores.
            </p>
            <p>
                These were very effective, however Orden had sent an elite squad, the first of their kind. A group of
                shadows. Men trained in magic, and stealth who moved through the night like phantoms. They were designed
                to infiltrate, spy, and assassinate. The squad made their way to Caladros, and while they were there they
                watched the dwarves work, they watched them set up their defenses, and they took note of how they created
                things. The squad disabled every new trap the Dwarves set, and when the city seemed safe from attack, the
                squad gave the word that the time for an attack was now. The warriors of the Alliance made quick work to
                take Caladros, and enslaved the dwarves for their war efforts. This was a turning point in the war, the
                Alliance now held positions on both sides of Feldron, and now they possessed war machines and weapons built
                by the Dwarves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zacharia sent word to the Fey of Elfwind, "The Alliance has taken Valendor, they have Dwarven made weapons
                of war, and they are coming to take the rest of the world. What makes you think you won't fall to that same
                fate?" The Fey were wary to trust the humans, after all it was their kind which had begun the war in the
                first place, but the council couldn't afford the risk, and decided it would be in their best interests to
                help fight against the Urwindgaurd Alliance. With the power of the Centurions and the Fey the Alliance was
                pushed from the borders of Feldron bringing them into the fray with them. Norn became a powerful stronghold
                as well, bringing forces from Norn and Elfend against the Windrum forces. The forces uniting against the
                Alliance became known as the Pact. They would free Delmora, bringing the Dunadora, and the Druma to their
                side, and taking back Valendor, freeing the dwarves from their captors.
            </p>
            <p>
                It soon became clear to Krav that he was losing, and in his time of need there came a shadow. An entity
                appeared before Krav, it was weakened, but Krav could sense it's power. "You're losing Krav, without my
                help you cannot defeat the Pact. How about a deal?" The entity spoke to Krav, whispering in his ears, and
                coaxing him into a deal. The entity would help him build an army, and Krav would provide it with souls.
                The souls of his enemies, or if he should fail, the souls of Krav and his kin. Krav was given the power
                to create new life for a time. He created monsters, goblins, hobgoblins, and such to wreak havoc on the
                Pact, and created a new race of humanoids, the Orcs. Build for war, and battle they were given life, and
                made to fight in Krav's army. As this was happening the Pact forces arrived at the shores of Orden. Emperor
                Nori fought alongside his men, and met King Zacharia in battle head on. The next day the battle was over,
                King Zacharia stood before a burning pyre of the dead, and paid respects to those fallen including Nori.
                A new emperor would take his place, Nori's son Akira. Akira joined the Pact as he had always secretly sided
                with, and warned them of Krav's growing forces. As the Pact marched toward Urlend the intel proved vital,
                though the journey was not easy. The Pact faced many monsters, and hordes of goblins. Some of the creatures
                were worse than others, but the goblins, despite being small and fairly easy to dispatch, were a real problem
                due to their massive numbers. It wouldn't stop the large forces of the Pact from arriving at the Urban Empire
                however, and after the battle against Krav's army of Ur and Orcs King Zacharia arrived at Krav's keep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon arrival however, Krav was dead, and above him crept a shadow. As Zacharia approached with his top
                soldiers, the shadow took shape. A tall thin humanoid figure with red skin, long sharp claws, pitch black
                eyes and hair, and long horns which swept back with its hair sat atop the throne over head of Krav, its
                tail wrapped tightly around the throat of Krav. "Hello Zach." The devil spoke slyly. "I see you made it
                all this way. That's too bad, I suppose Krav and his children will have to pay the price." The devil
                motioned to the corner, a small heap of bodies lay dead. Krav's children, the youngest a four year old girl.
                Whatever this thing was, it was evil beyond that of man. "What are you fiend?" Zacharia spat. "Normally
                I don't do introductions, but as I'm about to take your soul for my collection... After all, you ought to
                know the name of your new master... I am Faust." Within the blink of an eye the entity was standing over
                a wounded Zacharia, his long claws raised. As Zacharia lay there, unsure of what had happened, but feeling
                his life fading, he watched as Faust's laughter was brought to a halt by a blade run through his body. The
                wound was not fatal, but damning nonetheless. Faust shrieked, and with quick wit he escaped into a shadowy
                crack in the stone beneath them. "Father..." a female voice spoke, as the wielder of the sword knelt down
                beside Zacharia. "Mira... you must take up my throne... I'm not long for this world, so listen closely dear.
                The war is done, but I'm afraid the world has changed for good. Lead them, be their queen, and lead them
                with love, and courage. I... I love..." With his final breath Zacharia had given Princess Mira her final
                orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a time Queen Mira, and the rest of the world powers kept the peace, a new ruler was found for Urlend.
                The Orcs were driven into the forests where they kept to themselves for a time. The people believed that
                they were the spawn of the Devil Faust, and so they were hated for a long time. However as time went on,
                the peace fell apart, as more wars were fought. The orcs became accepted over time to a degree, though
                mostly they still kept to themselves, and lived in their Orcish communities. The world had changed. The
                war had brought about death, monsters, a new man made race, and revealed the existence of devils, and demons.
                The war had also brought about a new sort of coexistence between the races. Racism was still a very rampant
                thing, but the different races largely coexisted together in the different communities. Though humanity
                brought about many horrible things, they did manage to bring the coexistence that the Storyteller sought.
