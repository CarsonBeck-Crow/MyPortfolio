            <h2>Beyond Fertility Goddesses: Reexamining the Roles of Women in Prehistoric and Pre-Modern Art</h2>
            <h3>An Art History Essay</h3>
            <h3>By Carson Beck</h3>
        </section>

        <section id="story-content" class="story-content">
            <p>
                I feel, without a doubt, that it is unrealistic to attribute all prehistoric statuary of women to be fertility
                goddesses, or even simply a goddess. There are definitely a lot of examples where it is true, but after
                the paleolithic era, you find a change in topics. The Venus of Willendorf, a statue discovered in Germany
                dating back to the Paleolithic era is a great example of a statue that falls under the category of fertility
                goddess. The statue has greatly exaggerated features that accentuate the ideals of fertility, and you can
                tell that it has some form of god like origin because the stone it is carved of is not found anywhere near
                the cave it was found in. These people were nomadic, and they didn’t carry much, so for this to have been
                carried out so far shows that this statue likely was used in some sort of worship, or even perhaps for good
                fortune. The other statue I’ll bring to light is not one, but multiple little statues that all look the same,
                the Syros Woman. The Syros woman was found in the Cyclades, particularly in Syros, and it was found amongst
                graves. It dates back to 2600 BCE, still within the range of the prehistoric era. The Syros Woman is a very
                angular statue, and is believed to have been a grave good, or a symbolic gesture to mark the graves of mothers.
                So why does this matter? And what does it mean?
            </p>
            <p>
                The Venus of Willendorf is a very curvaceous statue. Its belly is round, its breasts are large, and its
                legs are large. This statue is large and in charge. Its arms are not however, they are thin, and draped
                over her ample bosom, they’re almost not even there. The head of the statue is a large sphere, inhuman,
                and mysterious. The statue shows the ideal body of the time for women. It was a woman capable of childbirth
                with great ease, it was a greatly exaggerated image, something to strive for, but never achieve. It is,
                I feel, undeniably the figure of some form of deity. It was something so important that despite the size
                of it, and the nomadic nature of their group, that they would carry it over large distances. Time was scarce,
                the most important thing for these people was survival, and yet they took the time to carve this statue,
                and carry it around with them. It was undeniably something revered by these people.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Syros Woman is not curvaceous. The Syros Woman is very triangular, and sharp. She has breasts, in the
                form of little bumps on a flat chest, and a waist that grows smaller overtime. She is not the symbol of
                fertility. Until you look at her arms which crossover where her womb would be, a common visual indicating
                fertility. So what could this mean? Well taking a look at the culture, and where it was found it could mean
                a few things. These were found near graves, and there wasn’t just one, but many of these statues. This group
                of people was not nomadic, they were a society. There are a few ideas, one of which is that she is a goddess
                figure, but I think there is more evidence to support that she is simply a grave good, or a marker of a
                mother. Due to there being multiple of them, and being placed on only some graves it’s much more likely
                that they were meant to show that a mother had been buried there. A sort of epitaph describing who she was.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yes, fertility is a commonality between these two statues, but the matter is godhood. The Venus of
                Willendorf is an exaggeration of beauty, and beauty at that time meant great birthing ability the Venus
                of Willendorf exudes this in every way. And the nomadic people who carved and carried her revered that.
                But the Syros Woman did not represent godhood. It showed the idea of motherhood. It showed the passing of
                a mother, and she was honored by her society for her fertility. The Syros Woman is not a statue showing
                beauty, and it is not something that was as greatly revered. There wasn’t just one statue, there were many.
                They weren’t meant to honor a god, they were meant to honor a mother. The statues are stark opposites of
                each other. One a vessel of worship, the other a token of honor. Though prehistoric female statues dealt
                with fertility a lot, they weren’t necessarily all goddesses, and my thoughts on the Syros Woman could be
                all way off, but we’ll likely never know the truth, and that is why we must discuss these things, so that
                we might be able to share new ideas, and come to different conclusions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In pre modern art, as time continued the figure of a female as a subject has changed. Fertility is only
                a part of the equation. A very popular figure is the Virgin Mary. Who isn’t depicted because of her fertility,
                but to honor her as an important figure. The woman chosen by God to be the mother of Christ. Though she
                is revered in a fashion similar to that of a god, she is not a goddess. She is the mother. The change over
                time is that now it is not fertility that is important, it is the role of motherhood. In other forms of art,
                there are other depictions of women, most of which are mothers, Queen Anne is a great example, she is
                depicted as not only a great mother, but as a Teacher to King Louis XIV. The change in context of art depicting
                women is actually much the same, Mary is a mother, and nearly revered as a godlike figure, while Anne is
                a mother, and a teacher. So you have a basis for the art, in the past it was fertility, now it is motherhood,
                and in addition what made them important mothers.
