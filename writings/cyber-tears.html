                Back in September Cyberpunk 2077 dropped, and to the disappointment of millions the game was a massive
                bomb for the fans waiting to play. It wasn’t just over promise, it was a betrayal by CD Projekt Red who
                was revered for their customer first mindset with the Witcher 3. The disappointment of finding out that
                the star of the gaming community was nothing more than a big gaseous cloud of corporate greed. Fitting given
                the nature of Cyberpunk.

                Where do we start with this game? Like I seriously don’t know. The beginning? I guess, the beginning. So
                back when I played the Witcher 3 for the first time in 2016, the teaser for Cyberpunk had been out for three
                years already. When Ciri told Geralt about the world she had visited, everyone was like, “She went to cyberpunk!”
                I was like, “Whoa! That’s really cool!” And then I didn’t think about it, like at all, cause at the time
                the teaser was just a cinematic, and I didn’t really know anything about the project. So I forgot about it.
                Over the years it would pop up, and it seemed really cool, but I didn’t get hyped over it. Then 2019 E3 came
                around, and so did Keanu.

            <p>
                Keanu Reeves is the man, let’s just get that out of the way right now. I love Keanu. He’s the best, and
                everyone agrees. Let it be known that I absolutely do not blame him for anything that went wrong with this
                game, because of course I don’t that would be silly. CDPR however can go fuck themselves for selling us a
                game by slapping everyone’s favorite celebrity on the cover and running with it. I mean of course that’s
                not the only thing they did though. On top of that they released a badass cinematic trailer, and an even
                cooler gameplay demo that showed off all the cool stuff you could do! Except when the game launched, you
                couldn’t do any of it. So what the fuck happened?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well actually we knew before the game came out that stuff had been removed. Things like vertical movement
                i.e. wall climbing, and running. Things like being able to purchase other apartments, vehicle customization,
                more voices for V than just Male or Female. These were just some of the things we knew had been cut before
                the game dropped. Yet the hype train kept chugging. Right into a massive ditch. We had no idea that the
                game would fail to deliver on so much more. No full day/night cycle, the NPC’s weren’t vibrant or alive,
                they were mindless, and some of the worst NPC’s in any RPG I’d ever seen. No interesting dialogue, choices
                didn’t really matter, and the story had good moments, but overall was disappointing. Even the “Good” ending
                was just a bummer.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s all Cyberpunk was, just really disappointing, and the thing is, if they do fix the problems this
                game had, which I don’t know if they even can at this point. I’d happily hop right back in, and have a great
                time, but until then I don’t really care anymore. This was supposed to be my new Skyrim, and unfortunately,
                it was just another Fallout 76. I’m not mad, or sad about the situation, because apart from when I see them
                in headlines, trying to fix the game, I just don’t even think about CDPR anymore. Sorry for dredging up
                possibly the most disappointing game of 2020; I just needed to let it out there.
