        What’s going on with Stuart Little’s world? It’s a question I had a few years back. It was the start of covid, and
        I was working in an amazon warehouse packing boxes. I couldn’t listen to music, or chat idly with coworkers, so I
        had a lot of time to think. I was working from 6PM to 6AM, and during that time my thoughts began to turn to places
        that I’d otherwise never have ventured.
      </p>
      <p>
        This video has been sitting in my mind for four years, waiting for the day I was finally ready to figure it out,
        and make the damn thing. Today I’m here to ask the question. Today you will be cursed with the same thing I have
        been for nearly half a decade now. So I ask again, what’s going on with the world of Stuart Little?
      </p>
      <p>
        *Part 1 setup*
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me give a brief overview of the movie, spoilers ahead, but like it’s 1999’s Stuart Little. So Mr, and Mrs
        Little are looking to adopt a son, because the one they have is a bit too fleshy. They show up at an orphanage
        and there’s all these scrungly orphans running around. Naturally the Little family is pretty put off by this, until
        a voice that sounds very reminiscent of Teen Wolf gets their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait a minute… Teen Wolf?…
      </p>
      <p>
        *Insert dumb visual joke*
      </p>
      <p>
        So the Littles look down and wow. They almost killed Stuart. Like look how close they were to sitting on him.
        This movie was almost a lot… littler… *insert Seinfeld music*
      </p>
      <p>
        So this scene is what I want to take a look at. The littles go to adopt a kid, and suddenly hear a voice they can’t
        seem to find the source of. They look down and see not just a mouse, but a mouse in a red sweater and tennis shoes,
        reading a tiny copy of little women.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do the little’s…
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>react with fear?</li>
        <li>react with confusion?</li>
        <li>react with excitement?</li>
        <li>have literally no reaction?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Got your answers ready?
      </p>
      <p>
        They are not in any way shape or form surprised by a talking humanoid mouse. Now listen. People joke about this
        scene all the time, saying things like, “Imagine some people come to your orphanage and instead of adopting you,
        they adopt a mouse.” And sure that’s a silly thing to imagine, but that’s smoke and mirrors boys. The real thing
        to pay attention to is the fact that the Little’s are unfazed by Stuart.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no way that this is the first time they’ve seen or heard of a talking mouse man. This raises a lot of
        questions for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        *Part 2 the questions*
      </p>
      <p>
        The first question I want to ask is how consistent this is with the world? To answer that we need to answer a few
        other questions first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are there other talking mouse people?
      </p>
      <p>
        Are there other animals that can talk and are humanoid?
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions have somewhat definite answers. Firstly yes there are other mouse folk. The conflict of the movie
        comes when a mouse folk couple shows up at the Little’s house claiming to be Stuart’s real family. Not only does
        this prove that there are other mouse folk, but it proves that there is likely some level of society of mouse folk,
        because these aren’t even his real parents. Also, when we first meet Stuart he’s reading a tiny copy of Little Women,
        I’ve never seen a book that small that was a functional real book. That means that there are probably mouse printing
        presses. And we can infer, there is a mouse folk society.
      </p>
      <p>
        But are there other talking humanoid animals? Yes and no. There are other talking animals, the birds in this world,
        or at least some birds in this world can speak. In Stuart Little 2 we meet Margalo who speaks English and wears
        an aviator hat and scarf. But unlike Stuart she isn’t humanoid. As for Falcon, we can’t say for sure, he never
        directly interacts with the humans. What about the cat though?
      </p>
      <p>
        Snowbell is an interesting case. We the audience see him talk to Stuart, but never do we see the Littles and Snowbell
        talking. Also he’s not treated like a person, but like a pet. The movie even acknowledges that he’s a pet. It’s
        the driving force behind the main antagonist, that a mouse shouldn’t be the master of a cat. There’s debate about
        whether the humans can or cannot understand snowbell, some say that they can, but that they ignore him. Others say
        cats just hide it because they don’t want the humans to hear them. Personally I think if they could talk, humanity
        would know, and they wouldn’t keep them as pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we know now that there is consistency in the world of talking animals and humanoid mice. Great. So what?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well I want to know how they came to be and where the rest of them are.
      </P>
      <p>
        Did mice evolve into this form?
      </p>
      <p>
        Did they mutate similar to four teenage reptiles and their rat father?
      </p>
      <p>
        Are we in a fantasy world in which mouse folk have always existed alongside humans?
      </p>
      <p>
        Are they the byproduct of a lab experiment gone right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or there’s the worst case scenario:
      </p>
      <p>
        Did someone get down with a mouse?
      </p>
      <p>
        Oof. Yeah, bet you weren’t thinking that we’d be asking that question today. This is what I mean when I tell you
        I’ve been cursed with this knowledge. This lore. Once you start asking these questions, and looking deeper, it
        changes you. You can never view Stuart Little the same again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course there’s the next thing, where are all the mouse folk? Mice reproduce like crazy, sure some eat their
        young, which presumably isn’t happening here, because they’re basically human, so where are all the other mouse
        folk? Stuart’s fake parents live in a mini golf course, and answer to the cat mafia. Which is weird, but sure. Then
        there’s Stuart’s real parents, which the orphanage lady tells the Littles that Stuart’s real parents died in a freak
        Cream Mushroom soup accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait- What?
      </P>
      <p>
        Oh my god. Is this movie the subconscious reason why I don’t like Cream of Mushroom soup?
      </P>
      <p><s>
        *Insert bit of me going to the store, buying Cream of Mushroom soup, trying it, not liking it, and deciding that
        it’s not because of this movie.*
      </s></p>
      <p>
        If there is a mouse society they’re clearly second rate citizens, so much so that they can be bullied and eaten
        by common house pets, and killed by something as simple and common as a stack of falling soup cans. If I had to
        guess, mouse society is underground. That’s the obvious answer here. They probably don’t come up to the surface
        much. Probably keep to themselves. But clearly some do, like Stuart and the Stouts. This begs a final question,
        the penultimate question, the question that you naturally come to when you consider all these things for as long
        as I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        *Part 3 the final question*
      </p>
      <p>
        You think humans and mouse folk fu-
      </p>
      <p>
        *Smash cut to the end.*
      </p>
      <p>
        So yeah, thanks for watching the video. I really have been wanting to make this for a long time, and I’m glad that
        I finally have. I originally intended on making a video that would follow this one, about the making of this video,
        the idea was to follow the process from start to finish as a way of helping other people who want to make videos
        learn how to do that. I may still do that down the line, but for now I’m going to focus on making videos about
        topics I enjoy. This channel is going to be full of video essays about shit I like, story time videos where I share
        things about my life for the benefit of my own therapy, and hopefully to the benefit of other people who feel alone
        in similar things. Those are the broad strokes, but there’ll probably be other types of content as well. Anyways,
        thanks for stopping by, and I’ll see you when I post the next thing!
