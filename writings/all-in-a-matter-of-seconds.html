            <p>
                If you’re reading this, I very well may be dead. My name was Jason Loyd. Today was my 23rd birthday.
                Growing up, I’d always loved superhero comics. The Flash had always been my favorite; super speed always
                seemed like such a limitless power. In movies and TV shows, they’d depict speedsters moving through time
                at a normal pace while everything around them slowed to a crawl. It almost seemed like super speed and
                the ability to slow down time were one and the same. Which, realistically, maybe there is no difference
                at the end of the day. I suppose it depends on the perspective. Anyway, all this to explain my current
                situation. By the time you’re reading this, I’ll have been gone for possibly a few minutes, maybe half
                an hour, or even a few hours. For me, it’s been years.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don’t know me, of course. I’m not from here. I walked to this city a few months ago looking for some
                books on physics and theories about relativity. I found a few things, but nothing tangible.
            </p>
            <p>
                See, I had been having a pretty terrible birthday. I’d lost my job, I’d been splashed with gutter water
                by a passing car, and my girlfriend was going to be in another city for the next two weeks. When I got
                home, though, things took a turn, and everything started to get a lot better. She’d come home to
                surprise me. She was sitting in our tiny little apartment, a few of our friends had come to celebrate as
                well, and she’d handed me a cupcake with a single lit candle. I made a wish, one that I now regret for
                the rest of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time suddenly seemed to freeze around me. I was so confused, so scared, and I started to panic. I left
                my apartment, only to find that the world around me had come to a standstill. I found out very quickly
                that I couldn’t use my phone. It seemed basically unresponsive to my touches and gestures. I tried to
                speak with people, I tried to use computers, but nothing worked. After what felt like half a day had
                passed, I pulled my phone out again to find that the screen had shattered. Everything started to fit
                together. I found myself at my local library, and I sat in front of a clock watching the hands and
                waiting. I waited for what, to me, felt like hours, but I couldn’t leave. I had to confirm what was
                going on. Finally, I saw the second hand of the clock begin to move at a snail's pace before it came
                to a halt again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn’t know at the time just how fast I was moving, but I’ve since learned. For me, each second of
                real time is equivalent to a full 24 hours. Which means, at the normal pace I’m walking, I’m actually
                moving at 99.9999999815% of the speed of light, or 671,080,885.53 mph. It took me forever to figure that
                out. I spent what felt like a full month agonizing over that single thing. Not being able to use
                calculators really destroyed me. The thing about moving at that speed is that I should be dead. My body
                should have burned to ash, and I should have been incinerated. At least, that’s what physics would say.
                However, I seem to have developed a number of other adaptive traits to let me survive these speeds. My
                body’s durability is insane. Believe me, once I realized what was happening, I tried to end it all. I
                jumped off a ten-story building and crashed down into the asphalt street below. I walked away with
                barely a scratch. I could see a few cracks forming on the street when I landed, and when I went back
                there like a day or two later, there was a massive crater in the ground. My body seems to be shielded
                from wind friction, which is certainly a blessing—not just for me, but for every person I came across.
                They would likely be vaporized by the heat of an object moving at these speeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frankly, I don’t even know if these words will ever reach anyone. I’ve been writing everything down, but
                for all I know, this whole journal is going to burst into flames in a few days, given how fast I’m
                writing in it. I guess we’ll just have to see. There are other things too. I don’t breathe anymore. I
                don’t sleep. I don’t eat or drink. In comics, speedsters have to consume more food than anyone else
                because their bodies are working at such high rates. For me, though, it seems like my body adapted by
                turning those functions off. Theoretically, I’m immortal now, I think, but I’m not entirely sure. It’s
                possible that my body may still age. Not enough time has passed yet for me to be able to tell.
                Truthfully, I hope that I will age and die. I already feel as if I’m losing myself in this place. I
                haven’t spoken to anyone in a year. I rarely hear sounds at all. Light is roughly a million times faster
                than sound, so it never really gets to me in time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m so scared. I’m so alone. I just want this to be over. I want this to stop. I want to be back home. I
                want to be with my family and friends. I’ve been back to see them a number of times, and it always
                breaks my heart. I see the look on my girlfriend’s face, frozen in horror, as she watches me disappear
                instantaneously. For her, I was there one second and gone the next. The only way she or anyone else
                could perceive me, even for 0.1 seconds, would require me to stand completely still for 144 days in my
                time. Even in my state of not needing to sleep, eat, or breathe, I don’t know if I could ever achieve
                that. I’m stuck in an eternal hell of being completely invisible and isolated from a world that barely
                moves around me. And there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it. At first, the idea was almost cosmic
                horror-esque—something you’d see on The Twilight Zone or read about in a Lovecraft story—but after so
                long of existing here, the dread has begun to change. I’m beginning to slip into an uncomfortable
                feeling of lethargy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back in the beginning, there was a time when I thought there was someone else here with me. Or something
                else, maybe. Every now and then, I’d see something moving just outside my vision. Or I’d blink, and
                something would flicker across my eyes, like when drivers start to fall asleep at the wheel and their
                brains trick them into seeing something run out in front of them to shock them awake. It didn’t take me
                long to understand what it was. I was losing my mind. I was hallucinating. Things got really bad for a
                time. The hallucinations plagued me frequently, and I could never quite glimpse them. It was breaking my
                psyche. That was when I learned that I could no longer enter water. Due to the speed I’m moving, the
                time it takes for the surface tension to break is far too long. It’s probably for the best, given all
                the other quirks of my curse, I’d probably end up stuck at the bottom of the ocean or something. That
                was before I’d learned that I was no longer breathing anyway. I wanted to drown myself. Sometime after
                that, the hallucinations largely faded. I think the shock of being pushed to the point of trying to
                drown myself, and being hit with the realization that I couldn’t, had broken something inside me. I
                still see those hallucinations sometimes. They creep in every once in a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve been reading a lot. It’s one of the few things I’m able to do at these speeds. Like I said before,
                I’m learning as much as I can about physics and theories like the theory of relativity. However, so much
                of it has gone over my head, and I’m starting to lose hope that books like those would even help me
                anyway. I mean, surely if there was anything that could help me in one of those books, we’d have figured
                out how to travel at light speed already, right? I don’t know. I have no idea what to do. I don’t even
                really know what caused this. I made a silly fucking wish on a birthday cupcake, for fuck’s sake. Now
                I’m stuck in this fucked existence. I have no idea if anyone will ever know what happened to me. I have
                no idea what to do. I thought about leaving this with my girlfriend or my family, but I couldn’t bring
                myself to do it. The thought of them reading this killed me inside. What little left there is to kill.
                That’s why I brought it to you. Not that it’ll do me any good. I mean, by the time you’re done reading
                this, who knows how long will have passed. For all I know, all the moving around I’ve been doing is
                speeding up global warming or something, and I’m gonna bring about the end of the fucking world. Not
                that I’ll be coherent enough to see it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a plan. It’s not a way out. It’s not freedom from this curse. It’s just the end. I won’t be able
                to get out of this existence. I just won’t. I came to accept that over the course of writing this. The
                little hope I had left has gone from me, and all I have now are these words on these pages. I’m going to
                walk across the surface of the planet and see all the beautiful places I once wanted to visit, and when
                that’s all said and done, I’m going to find the nearest ocean, sit on top of the water, and wait. I’ll
                wait, and wait, and wait until I sink to the bottom of the ocean. Perhaps I’ll explore the undersea if
                I’m able to, but most likely, I’ll just sit there, beneath the water, waiting for my brain to shut off
                due to the agony of time, or due to death by aging. Whichever comes first. If neither comes, then I’ll
                just have to think of something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for listening to my story. I appreciated your company while I sat and wrote this. I was
                sitting just next to you the whole time. Of course, by the time you’re seeing this, I’ll be long gone.
                Across the planet, or sleeping beneath the waves. My name was Jason Loyd. This was the story of how I
                became cursed with super speed.
