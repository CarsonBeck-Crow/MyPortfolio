            <h2>The Creation of Storallia</h2>
            <h3>By Carson Beck</h3>
        </section>

        <section id="story-content" class="story-content">
           <p>
               When the Storyteller shone his light on the world, he was alone. All that existed was the material plane,
               and the beyond, where the heavenly bodies lay. Our world was drab, and bleak. The Storyteller lit the
               first flame deep within the core of the world, and as the sediment, and minerals began to heat, the
               Storyteller began to work, sculpting the world with the help of the first flame. As the world's form began
               to take shape, the Storyteller allowed the world to freeze over in thick ice. As the ice formed the
               Storyteller tended to the flame, keeping it alight, and when the world was set, the flame melted the ice
               into a vast sea that encompassed our world.
           </p>
            <p>
                The Storyteller was indebted to the flame, and the seas for helping him make his world, and in return
                gave them names, and the power to create and destroy. Elrena, the Goddess of Fire, was gifted a son by
                the Storyteller, his name was Emerous, and he became the sun. Vudea, the Goddess of the Seas, was gifted
                a daughter, her name was Lyseia, and she was life itself. Vudea and Lyseia began to fill the seas with
                life, fish, plants, and the first of the intelligent races, the Trition and the Locathah. As they began
                to work, Elrena tasked Emerous to use his powerful rays of sunshine to reduce Vudea's seas, and reveal
                the lands she had helped to create. Emerous, and Lyseia did as they were asked, for a time knew nothing
                of the other's existance. Lyseia was hidden deep under the surface of the sea, far from the gaze of Emerous.
                But eventually, as the seas began to give way to land, and mountains towered over the seas Lyseia was
                greeted for the first time with the light of Emerous. Lyseia saw the barren lands before her, and thought
                to begin the growth of new life. Grass, trees, flowers, and animals of all shapes and sizes. Lyseia gave
                life to the second race, the Wood Elves, the first of which were born from the first trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emerous was taken by the beauty before him. He had never seen such greenery, never seen life. He followed
                Lyseia where she went, shining light down on her creations, giving them the energy they needed to live.
                Emerous fell deeply in love with Lyseia, their love was the first love, and thus Emerous, the sun, became
                the God of Love. Elrena began to dabble herself in using the life Lyseia brought to her lands, and created
                the Mountain Dwarves, the Giants, and Dragons. Through Lyseia, and Emerous' love, High Elves, Hill Dwarves,
                Halflings, and Gnomes were created to love the lands. The different races were fairly civil. There was
                vanity that each race had, but none felt particularly upset to do anything about it. They began to build
                their own civilizations, and pursue knowledge of their lands, and the arts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vudea was displeased with Lyseia, as she felt that Emerous had sapped away her power in diminishing her
                seas. She couldn't stand his happiness, and she feared for Lyseia's safety. These gods of the dominion
                of flame were destructive, and they could destroy all that Vudea had built. Vudea created the Moon, her
                son Lunaris, the God of Tranquility and Protection. Vudea commanded Lunaris to chase away Emerous, and
                protect Lyseia from all that would harm her. Lunaris took his role to heart, and began to hunt down
                Emerous. The world saw night, and day for the first time. On top of all of this, Lunaris used his power
                to keep Vudea at bay, and in check. He could feel Vudea's hatred for Lyseia's children, and sought to
                keep them safe. Seeing Lunaris' grace, a sect of High Elves formed in worship of the Moon. They seperated
                from their kin, and began to change, thus the Moon Elves were born. The Storyteller was proud of his
                creations, they had set to work just as intended, and a web of stories were waiting to be told. The
                Storyteller felt it was time for his final touch, before letting the world work it's own magic. Humans
                were created on the shores of the land. The perfect average of all the other races. The Storyteller
                wanted these people to bring the other races together, to create societies of all sorts of folk. Unfortunately
                while they did bring many together, they also brought about war, and death.
